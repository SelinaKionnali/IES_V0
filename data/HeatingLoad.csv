Thermal conductivity based on target performance of structurally insulated vaccuum panels under development,,,,,,,,,
"thicknesses are variable, thinner walls preferable to provide more interior space and lighter package weight",,,,,,,,,
Bridging estimates based on CAD but exist more as targets,,,,,,,,,
R and U values calculated with weighted average of material performance in each assembly,,,,,,,,,
Configurations based on different states of fold out (w/ greenhouse signifying significant passive solar glass),,,,,,,,,
Load calculations based on steady 23C interior tempt,,,,,,,,,
